## About

  Valmain is a software to replace the mp4 format in-game files responsible for the in-game main menu. This application is for those who want to change the main menu for themselves, but they are too lazy or forget to constantly change it manually.

## Instruction
### First step
- **-** **`Downloading `** - Install the files in the same directory.
-   If the files are in different folders or disks then nothing will work. For convenience, create a folder wherever you want and name it whatever you want.
- Download your choice of backgrounds in mp4 format and drop them into an empty folder.



### Second step



- **-** **`Installation Ways `** - Open the text file 'Folders' and specify in the first line the full path to the folder in which your background is installed.
- Save and close the file.
### Last step
- **-** **`Last stept `** - First of all, download Valmain.
- **-** **` Start `** - Run the script itself and wait for VALORANT to start.
